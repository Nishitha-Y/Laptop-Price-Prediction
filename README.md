# Laptop-Price-Prediction
This project aims to predict the price of laptops based on their specifications using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on features like brand, processor type, RAM, storage, operating system, screen size, and more.

## Project Workflow
-Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training with regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation
- Built and tested in Google Colab

##  Dataset
The dataset includes laptop specifications and corresponding prices. It contains features such as:
- Brand
- Screen Resolution
- RAM
- Storage (HDD/SSD)
- Operating System
- Display details
- Weight
- Price (target variable)

##  Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
